# ðŸ“Š PRODIGY_DS_TASKS

A collection of 5 data science tasks completed as part of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship. Each notebook demonstrates different concepts such as data cleaning, visualization, machine learning, classification, and regression.

## âœ… Task Overview

### ðŸ”¹ Task 01 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis
- Performed basic data inspection and visualization.
- Identified patterns, trends, and outliers using plots like histograms and heatmaps.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 02 â€“ Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values and data types.
- Encoded categorical variables and scaled features for model readiness.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 03 â€“ Machine Learning
- Built classification models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.
- Used train-test split and evaluated using accuracy and F1-score.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 04 â€“ Classification
- Implemented advanced classifiers.
- Evaluated models using confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification report.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 05 â€“ Regression
- Applied regression techniques such as Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- Evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and visualized model performance.
